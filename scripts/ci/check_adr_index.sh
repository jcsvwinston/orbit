# directory, which is exactly the state an index exists to prevent. Orbit
# showed the same rot in miniature before this guard existed: the index
# said "Proposed" for a record whose own frontmatter had been accepted for
# two months. The guard cannot read prose, so it checks the part that rots
# silently — the file/index correspondence.
